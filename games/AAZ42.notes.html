<b>World War II v5 1942 Second Edition-Alternative Setup with Zombies</b>
						<br>Land combat limited to 1 round. Zombies can not hit air units
						<br>Recruitment centers cost 10 and can only build infantry. Zombies spawn randomly at the start of each player's turn. An average of 2 Zombie will appear randomly in the world. In addition, groups of 10 zombies will sometime appear
						<br>For balance and because German occultists started the zombie apocalypse, 10 Zombies start in Germany.
						<br>Zombies win if they get an income of 40
						<br>Set Game/User Notifications/Show Trigger/Condition Change Roll Failure to off
						<br>Based upon Axis & Allies & Zombies
						<br>Player nations are not allowed to invade neutrals, but can move in once zombies have taken over.
						<br>Note that in this weerd alternate history scenario, the Zombies are restless dead (Draugr) and not contagious as in most modern zombie fiction. They are capable of using weaponry, but too impaired to handle sophisticated weaponry or coordinate their actions.
						<br>The dead were awakened uncontrallably by Nazi occultists
						<br>The big change from the original game is that Zombies are not spawned by killing infantry, as there was no way to handle that in TripleA. Instead every area has 1% chance per turn of spawning a horde of 10
