<b>World War II v5 1942 Second Edition-Alternative Setup</b>
						<br>This alternate setup is from the Axis & Allies Zombies, but without the zombies. The United States setup naval setup is messed up, so I left the original setup for ships and put a few more units in the Western United States. Recruitment centers cost 10 and can only build infantry. The game still strongly favors the Axis. a bid of 30 for Russia is the default and 15 for US & UK is the default.
